We help young people cope with cancer in their family. Through Canteen, they learn to explore and deal with their feelings about cancer, connect with other young people in the same boat and if they’ve been diagnosed themselves, we also provide specialist, youth-specific treatment teams."},{"name":"WWF","location":"Brisbane","link":"https://www.wwf.org.au/","imageloc":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/24/WWF_logo.svg","description":"WWF’s global mission is to stop the degradation of the planet’s natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.
